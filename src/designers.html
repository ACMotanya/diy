              <span class="thumb-info-caption-text">Rebecca started making jewelry as a 12-year-old kid who was bored one summer and needed a hobby. As the years have passed, jewelry making became more than just a hobby; it developed into a true passion. Rebecca dabbles in all types of different crafts, but jewelry making remains her favorite.

Rebecca manages a craft blog, My Girlish Whims, which is all about her crafty adventures and general life as a big girly girl. In the past two years Rebecca has graduated college, bought a house, got married, and started working full time. Now that things have settled down, Rebecca enjoys living in the Philadelphia suburbs with her husband Shawn and their golden doodle puppy, Jefferson. </span>

              <span class="thumb-info-caption-text">Shelly began creating jewelry in the early 1990s after being inspired by a high school project on recycling. She started out by recycling old broken jewelry and repairing a favorite piece. She then created pieces to give away as gifts, which later turned into requests for handmade items for friends, family and special occasions.

With over 10 years of experience as a graphic designer, Shelly merges the technical with the artistic. Shelly is self-taught. She has tried many different techniques and materials over the years and she is not afraid to try something new at least once- sometimes twice.

Shelly is a stay-at-home mom to two young boys and volunteers as the director of Women’s Ministries for Trinity Gospel Fellowship in Richland, MS. </span>
